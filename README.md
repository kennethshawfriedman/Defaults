Defaults
========

A simple OS X utility to very easily change mail and browser defaults.

The app is available for download: [here](http://kennethshawfriedman.com/defaults/). Just download, unzip the file, and open the `.prefPane` file and you're ready to go!

##Requirements

This version requires [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) to be installed. OS X Mavericks is recommended, but it should work on all previous versions (above 10.2).
